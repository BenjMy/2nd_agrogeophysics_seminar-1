## Roadmap

Roadmap for the organisation of the 2nd agrogeophysics seminar

- contributors: B. Mary, S. Garré
- location: in-presence Brussels (or other volunteers? ;-) ) / live streaming of presentations
- funding? none at the moment => do it as an SSSB seminar if in Brussels?
- possible date: February-March 2022

## Board

* board invitation - by mid October
    - G. Blanchy
    - A. Romero-Ruiz (Rothamsted)
    - C. Von Hebel (Xarvio)
* drafting the seminar outline/objectives - by mid October
* advertisement - by November


## Ideas 
* Geophysics for soil-plant interactions
    - bio-pedo-physics
    - phenotyping
    - transport process characterization (water, nutrients)     
* Geophysics for soil mapping and agricultural management support
    - soil proximal and remote sensing [@CVH]
    - scalability of soil properties [@CVH]
    - irrigation, soil compaction, fertilization
* Data management, codes and standards in agrogeophysics
    - reflexion about data-reuse
    - dataset/code benchmarking
       (ex: inversion of a synthetic dataset simulating RWU, combining different data sources, ...)
* Frontiers topic to agrogeophysic:
    - soil processes like carbon and nitrogen cycling

## To-do

- [x] Update the website (Logo,...)
- [ ] Prepare a **preregistration form** (helping to define the final schedule) including:
    - vote for discussion and benchmarking themes
