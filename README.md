## Ideas 
* Geophysics for soil-plant interactions
    - pedophysics
    - phenotyping       
* Geophysics for soil mapping and agricultural management support
    - soil proximal and remote sensing [@CVH]
    - scalability of soil properties [@CVH]
* Data management, codes and standards in agrogeophysics
    - reflexion about data-reuse
    - dataset/code benchmarking
       (ex: inversion of a synthetic dataset simulating RWU, combining different data sources, ...)
