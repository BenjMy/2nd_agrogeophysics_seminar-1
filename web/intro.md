About this event

After the success of the first edition '*Geophysics & Agriculture: the perfect match?*' in 2020, we are pleased to give you all a new opportunity to exchange knowledge, good practices, and passion on current trending topics in agrogeophysics.

Agrogeophysics looks for indices to understand the complex interplay between the soil, the plant(s), and the soil and the atmosphere. When applied to agriculture, geophysics targets physical quantities such as resistivity or permittivity indirectly related to soil and plant properties or hydrological variables. In the last years, several small-scale studies were conducted on a single plant to translate geophysical observations to state variables governing the soil-plant interactions. At the same time, fast developments UAV and satellite imagery also pushed larger-scale geophysical techniques forward creating new opportunities to map and support agricultural decisions. Although the field of agrogeophysics focusses strongly on water and solute management issues, we also wish to explore emerging frontier topics showing the potential of geophysical methods to characterize other soil-plant processes such as carbon and nitrogen cycling, the evolution of soil structure, soil salinisation and salt-coping strategies in plants, ....

We therefore welcome contributions from any type of agrogeophysical research and particularly encourage the participation of early-career scientists who are interested to work across groups, scales, and disciplines.

In an **interactive session**,  we will work with those interested in some of the new initiatives in data management, codes integration, and standards in agrogeophysics and will encourage the gathering of pedophysical data.
