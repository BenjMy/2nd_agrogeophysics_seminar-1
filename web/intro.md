# About this event

After the success of the first edition '*Geophysics & Agriculture: the perfect match?*' in 2020, we are pleased, 2 years later, to follow up with this 2nd edition and give to the community a new opportunity to exchange and gather their experience about current trending topics.

Geophysics when applied to Agriculture targets physical quantities (resistivity, permittivity,…)  that indirectly relate to soil hydrological variables (soil water content, …) and other quantities of interest (soil texture and structure and the organic matter content, ...). By consequence, Agrogeophysics is a discipline looking for indices to understand the complex interplay between the soil, the plant(s), and the soil and the atmosphere. We opted to build this seminar upon three main pillars where we welcome contributions to: 

* *Geophysics for soil-plant interactions*: plant scale studies conducted in the field or in controlled laboratory conditions on a single plant and addressing how to translate the geophysical measurements to state variables governing the system;
* *Geophysics for soil mapping and agricultural management support*: studies demonstrating current progress for soil mapping and agricultural management support from soil proximal to remote sensing. We expect the contribution to this topic to offer insights on how to properly define the spatial and temporal resolution and extension of the geophysical methods to be able to catch the overall system dynamically;
* *Frontiers topic to agrogeophysic*: studies showing the potential of geophysical methods to highlight soil processes like carbon and nitrogen cycling.

**An interactive session** will showcase some of the new initiatives in data management, codes integration, and standards in agrogeophysics and will encourage the gathering of petrophysical data. 

We particularly welcome engagement of early-career scientists who are interested to work across groups, scales, and disciplines.
