## Motivation

<p>
The use of geophysics for agronomy has rapidly increased in recent years. However, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of such heterogeneous data. There would be significant value gained and costs saved across academic research if geophysical users were to address key challenges to move towards FAIR<a href="#section1">[1]</a> data management in the near future.
</p>

The Catalog of [AgroGeophysical Studies](https://agrogeophy.github.io/catalog/) paves the way towards more open science and FAIR data/survey practices. This portal is providing a service to the community by putting together a database/catalog of agrogeophysical surveys on which we can build for future research. The current weakness is the lack of community formalisation of the metadata.


In this interactive hackathon session, we will work on 3 challenges, develop ideas and implement them in small teams. 

<div class="callout callout-warning">
📢 We believe in research community efforts and value your contribution! Ideas and contributors will be publicly available in the github page.

## Challenges

<div class="callout">

#### 1. How to encourage the emergence of standards in Agrogeophysics?

What kind of initiative(s) would help federate the community and help the emergence of standards? Which metadata are required in such standards? Best way to create them?


#### 2. How to build a library of robust/reusable pedophysical relationships? 



#### 3. How to encourage the use of geophysics in interdisciplinary studies?

How can you encourage a non-specialist to use geophysics? Which tools would they need to get familiar enough and see the potential and limitations of geophysics? 

</div>

## Materials 🗂️

Bring your own dataset or pick one of [ours](https://github.com/agrogeophy/2nd_agrogeophysics_seminar/tree/main/interactive_session/exemple_datasets) to get your hands dirty on the job. You don’t need to be a coder to attend. All ideas and competences are valuable!
