## About this event

_After the success of the first edition '*Geophysics & Agriculture: the perfect match?*' in 2020, we are pleased to give you all a new opportunity to exchange knowledge, good practices, and passion on current trending topics in agrogeophysics._


When applied to agriculture, geophysics targets physical quantities (resistivity, permittivity,elastic moduli ‚Ä¶) that indirectly relate to soil and plant properties or hydrological variables. By consequence, Agrogeophysics is a discipline looking for indices to understand the complex interplay between the soil, the plant(s), and the atmosphere. 

In the last years, particular attention has been devoted to the development of small-scale studies conducted on a single plant with the aim to translate geophysical observations to state variables governing the soil-plant interactions. On the other hand, we observed a momentum for larger-scale Geophysics using soil proximal to remote sensing in order to map and support agricultural decisions. Yet, although mainly focused on water management issues, agrogeophysics is not limited to and emerging frontiers topics show the potential of geophysical methods to highlight soil processes like carbon and nitrogen cycling.

## üìù 

You can submit any research related to agrogeophysics. We particularly welcome engagement of early-career scientists who are interested to work across groups, scales, and disciplines.

## üìà 

In an **interactive session**  we will work with those interested in some of the new initiatives in data management, codes integration, and standards in agrogeophysics and will encourage the gathering of pedophysical data.
