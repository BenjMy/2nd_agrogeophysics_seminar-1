**Under construction.**

## Ideas 

- quick overview of current ongoing research projects (organize afterwards in subthemes depending on submissions? -> 2 min/1 slide per project)
- pedophysical relationship (send excel form to participant to add their EC-WC data and soil texture/type and present results during webinar)
- reflexion about data-reuse (use of notebooks and control of environment, where to store data, notebook, how ensure it's reusable -> requirements.txt)
- dataset/code benchmarking
- ex: inversion of a synthetic dataset simulating RWU, combining different data sources, ...
- reflexion (like AGU town hall)
- could also do a context of geophysical inversion: given a synthetic noisy dataset, they need to filter and invert it and then we show the results (ERT, EMI) - we did this once for HKEx and that was quite interesting to suscitate discussion
- discussion on incertainty assessement beyond inversion: ensemble modelling, bayesian inversion, BEL
- workshop on hydrogeophysical inversion (getting root information from coupled hydrogeophy or simply showcasing how much can be recoverred by geophy (ERT, EMI, MALM))
- apart from presentations: also a practical workshop? -> practical like fieldwork? ERT in Brussels street? ;)
